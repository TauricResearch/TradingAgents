# Migration Plan: Stock Market â†’ Crypto Market

## Core Architectural Changes Required

### 1. **Data Layer Overhaul** (High Priority)
   - **Market Data Sources**:
     - Replace Alpha Vantage/yfinance with crypto-native APIs (CCXT, CoinGecko, Messari, Glassnode)
     - Add DEX data aggregators (The Graph, Dune Analytics)
     - Integrate on-chain analytics (Etherscan, blockchain explorers)

   - **New Data Types**:
     - 24/7 market data (no market close)
     - Order book depth and liquidity metrics
     - On-chain metrics (active addresses, transaction volume, whale movements)
     - DeFi protocol TVL and yields
     - Cross-exchange arbitrage opportunities

### 2. **Analyst Team Modifications**

   **Technical Analyst** - Major changes:
   - Adapt to 24/7 trading (no gaps, different volatility patterns)
   - Add crypto-specific indicators (NVT ratio, MVRV, Funding rates)
   - Exchange-specific volume analysis (spot vs perpetuals)

   **Fundamentals Analyst** - Complete rewrite:
   - Replace balance sheets with: Tokenomics, emission schedules, circulating supply
   - Network health metrics: Hash rate, validator count, staking ratios
   - Protocol revenue and treasury analysis
   - Competitor analysis (layer-1s, DeFi protocols)

   **News Analyst** - Enhanced sources:
   - Crypto-native media (CoinDesk, The Block, Decrypt)
   - Social platforms (Crypto Twitter/X, Reddit r/cryptocurrency)
   - Regulatory announcements (SEC, global regulators)
   - Protocol governance proposals

   **Social/Sentiment Analyst** - Expanded role:
   - Twitter/X influencer tracking
   - Discord/Telegram community sentiment
   - Reddit sentiment (r/cryptocurrency, r/bitcoin)
   - On-chain sentiment (long/short ratios, liquidation data)

   **New Analyst Needed**: **On-Chain Analyst**
   - Whale wallet tracking
   - Exchange inflow/outflow analysis
   - Smart contract interaction patterns
   - Network congestion and gas fees

### 3. **Risk Management Overhaul**

   **New Risk Factors**:
   - Smart contract risk (protocol hacks, exploits)
   - Regulatory risk (SEC actions, country bans)
   - Liquidity risk (low-cap altcoins, rug pulls)
   - Bridge/custody risk
   - Correlation to Bitcoin (market beta)

   **Position Sizing**:
   - Tiered approach: BTC/ETH (larger positions) vs altcoins (smaller)
   - Volatility-adjusted sizing (crypto is 3-5x more volatile)
   - Exchange risk limits (avoid concentration on single CEX)

### 4. **Trading Execution Changes**

   **Broker Integration**:
   - Replace MT5/IBKR with: Binance, Coinbase Pro, Kraken APIs
   - CCXT library for unified exchange interface
   - Consider DEX integration (Uniswap, 1inch)

   **Order Types**:
   - Support for perpetual futures and options
   - Funding rate considerations
   - Limit orders with time-in-force variants

   **Risk Controls**:
   - 24/7 monitoring (no weekends off)
   - Flash crash protection (circuit breakers)
   - Exchange outage handling

### 5. **Backtesting Framework Adjustments**

   **Data Requirements**:
   - Sub-second tick data for volatile periods
   - Cross-exchange price discrepancies
   - Realistic slippage models (higher than stocks)
   - Exchange downtime simulation

   **Performance Metrics**:
   - Sharpe ratio targets: 1.5-2.5 (vs 1.2 for stocks)
   - Max drawdown tolerance: 30-40% (vs 15% for stocks)
   - Recovery time analysis

### 6. **LLM Prompt Engineering**

   **Context Adaptations**:
   - Train agents on crypto terminology (DeFi, NFTs, Layer-2s)
   - Update fundamental analysis prompts (no P/E ratios!)
   - Add regulatory uncertainty reasoning
   - Incorporate narrative-driven market dynamics

### 7. **Configuration Changes**

```python
CRYPTO_CONFIG = {
    "data_vendors": {
        "market_data": "ccxt",           # Unified exchange data
        "on_chain_data": "glassnode",    # On-chain metrics
        "fundamental_data": "messari",   # Token fundamentals
        "news_data": "cryptopanic",      # Crypto news aggregator
        "social_data": "lunarcrush",     # Social sentiment
    },
    "trading_hours": "24/7",
    "asset_classes": ["spot", "perpetuals", "options"],
    "exchanges": ["binance", "coinbase", "kraken"],
    "risk_multiplier": 3.0,              # Higher volatility
    "max_position_size": 0.05,           # 5% per position (vs 10% stocks)
}
```

## Implementation Roadmap

## Key Challenges & Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|
| 24/7 markets | Automated monitoring, cloud-hosted bots |
| Higher volatility | Tighter risk limits, volatility-adjusted sizing |
| Exchange risk | Multi-exchange diversification, custody solutions |
| Regulatory uncertainty | Conservative position sizing, compliance monitoring |
| Data quality | Multiple data source validation, outlier detection |
| Smart contract risk | Whitelist protocols, audit score checks |

## Estimated Effort

- **Data layer rewrite**: 40% of total effort
- **Agent prompt re-engineering**: 25%
- **Backtesting framework**: 20%
- **Risk management updates**: 10%
- **Testing & validation**: 5%

**Total timeline**: 4-6 months for production-ready system

## Next Steps

1. Choose primary data vendors (recommend CCXT + Glassnode)
2. Set up sandbox environments for major exchanges
3. Begin data pipeline implementation
4. Create crypto-specific analyst agent prototypes
5. Validate on historical data before live deployment
