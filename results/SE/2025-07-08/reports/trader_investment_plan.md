After carefully weighing the detailed bull and bear analyses and considering the current technical signals and valuation metrics, the most prudent course is to maintain the existing position in Sea Limited but with a disciplined, risk-managed approach.

The companyâ€™s strong long-term growth potential and institutional support warrant staying invested, yet ongoing technical weakness and high valuation levels require caution. Active risk controls, notably a stop-loss near the $150 support level, will help avoid outsized losses if momentum deteriorates further. Equally important is waiting for clear signs of technical recovery and margin improvement before deploying additional capital, avoiding value traps in a volatile environment.

This balanced strategy safeguards capital while preserving upside optionality, aligning with lessons learned about timing and risk in high-growth tech stocks. It also aligns with a medium-to-long term horizon that still respects evolving market conditions.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
