This analysis suggests that SE is in a longer-term uptrend but currently experiencing a short-term momentum loss and potential consolidation. Traders could watch price behavior around the 50 SMA for signs of support or further pullback. The bearish MACD histogram and falling RSI advise caution on new bullish positions until momentum confirms renewed strength. Moderate volatility implies risk is steady but manageable.
