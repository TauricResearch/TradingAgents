Over the period from June 1, 2025, to July 8, 2025, TSLA's stock price exhibited considerable volatility and fluctuations, particularly noticeable during the first week of June.

#### Indicator Analysis

1. **50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: As of July 7, 2025, the 50 SMA was approximately **318.18**. This moving average serves as a medium-term trend indicator, showing a potential support level. As TSLA trades below this level, it suggests weakness in the stock's performance.

2. **200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: The 200 SMA was around **314.50** on July 3, indicating a stable long-term trend. Trading below this level can indicate bearish sentiment, reinforcing the short to medium-term weaknesses observed with the 50 SMA.

3. **10-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: The 10 EMA was reported as **319.40** on July 3. This is more responsive to recent price changes and serves as a shorter-term trend indicator. The fact that TSLA is also trading below this EMA highlights ongoing bearish momentum.

4. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: As of July 3, 2025, the MACD was at **-1.03**, indicating negative momentum. Typically, when the MACD is below zero, it suggests that recent prices are below their average values, hinting at ongoing bearish conditions and the potential for further declines.

5. **MACD Signal Line**: The MACD signal for the same date was approximately **2.93**, indicating the difference between the MACD line and its 9-day EMA is positive, but given the overall negative MACD value, a bearish crossover is more likely.

6. **MACD Histogram**: The histogram, which shows the difference between the MACD line and the signal line, was **-2.61** on July 3. This negative value confirms increasing bearish pressure as the MACD line continues to fall below the signal line.

7. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: The RSI was **47.59** on July 3, suggesting that TSLA is in neutral territory. A value around 50 reinforces the lack of strong momentum either way. However, movements approaching the oversold region (below 30) or overbought region (above 70) in future analyses could indicate potential price reversals.

8. **Average True Range (ATR)**: The ATR was recorded at **16.51** on July 3, indicating moderate volatility in TSLA's price movements. Traders might consider this data when setting stop-loss levels, as higher ATR values suggest more significant price swings.

### Summary Analysis

The combination of readings from the moving averages, MACD, and RSI suggests that TSLA is currently in a bearish trend. The stock is under pressure from both medium-term (50 SMA) and long-term (200 SMA) perspectives, trading significantly below these averages. The MACD readings further reinforce the bearish outlook, with negative momentum in play. The RSI indicates a neutral state which, while less critical now, could lead to either a recovery or deeper declines based on upcoming trading activity.
