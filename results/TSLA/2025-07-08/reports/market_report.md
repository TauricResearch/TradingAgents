### Interpretation & Insight:
Tesla's stock has been through a mix of bullish and bearish phases over the past two months. The longer-term metrics (200 SMA) indicate an underlying bullish sentiment, but recent shifts in shorter-term indicators (10 EMA, RSI) and a declining MACD suggest caution. The market is currently in a bearish correction phase following significant bullish activity from May to June.

Prices are approaching the lower Bollinger Band, which often serves as a signal of potential price bottoming if accompanied by reversal signals. However, confirmation is necessary given the RSI and continued MACD bearish crossover signals.
