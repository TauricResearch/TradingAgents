Based on the retrieved data and technical indicators, here's my detailed analysis of SPY:

### Price Trend Analysis

Over the past year, SPY has shown a generally bullish trend with some significant volatility. The ETF started at around $461 in July 2024 and reached $477 by August 2024, showing early strength. The market then experienced some consolidation before resuming its upward movement.

In Q4 2024, SPY showed strong momentum, breaking above $490 by October and continuing to climb to $505 by November. This was followed by a minor correction in December before the uptrend resumed in early 2025.

As of the latest data point (July 3, 2025), SPY is trading at approximately $535, representing a significant move higher from where it started last year. This suggests a continuation of the bull market, with prices reaching new highs.
