- **Institutional Ownership:** ~95% of outstanding shares held by institutions
- **Recent Institutional Activity:** Net buying trend observed among large asset managers, particularly in anticipation of potential Fed rate cuts.

- **Earnings Growth:** S&P 500 companies reported strong Q2 earnings, with aggregate EPS growth of ~9% YoY.
- **Valuation Multiples:** Forward P/E ratio of ~22x, slightly above historical averages but justified by strong earnings momentum.

## Risks
- **Market Concentration Risk:** Heavy weighting toward mega-cap tech stocks may increase volatility if these names underperform.
