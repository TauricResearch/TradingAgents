"""Point-in-time rules shared by every dated path: data is served as of the run's date.

- ``as_of`` / ``as_of_window`` clamp a date or window the model asks for to the
  trade date, so no tool reaches a vendor with a later one.
- ``in_window`` trims dated items (news, StockTwits, Reddit) to the analysis
  window: timestamps normalized to UTC, the upper bound exclusive at midnight
  after ``end``, and an undated item kept only when the window reaches the
  present, since a backtest cannot prove it is not from the future (#1126, #1220).
- ``coverage_gap`` reports a window a feed cannot reach as unavailable, not empty.
- ``withhold_live_profile`` withholds present-day snapshots from historical runs.
