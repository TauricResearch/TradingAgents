"""Reddit search fetcher for ticker-specific discussion posts.

Default path is Reddit's public Atom/RSS search feed
(``reddit.com/r/{sub}/search.rss``). The richer JSON search endpoint
(``/search.json``) is reliably WAF-blocked (``HTTP 403``) for public clients
(issue #862), and probing it on every call only doubled our request volume
against Reddit's per-IP rate limit — tripping ``429`` on the RSS fallback — so
it is kept (``_fetch_subreddit_json``) but not used by default. On a 429 we back
off once (honouring ``Retry-After``). RSS lacks score / comment counts, so those
posts are marked and the formatter omits the metrics rather than printing fake
zeros.

No API key required. Returns formatted plaintext blocks ready for prompt
injection and degrades gracefully — returns a placeholder string rather than
raising, so callers never special-case missing data.
